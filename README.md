The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. I've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.


Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up

1.) Import establishments.json file

2.) Import libraries

3.) Create an instance of the Mongo Client

4.) Confirm if the data loaded properly

5.) Assign the collection to a variable



Part 2: Update the Database

1.) Insert a new restaurant data to Database

2.) Find the BusinessTypeID for "Restaurant/Cafe/Canteen" and return only the BusinessTypeID and BusinessType fields

3.) Update the new restaurant with the BusinessTypeID you found

4.) Delete data that related to Dover

5.) Convert latitude and longitude to decimal numbers



Part 3: Exploratory Analysis


1.) Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?

2.) Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?

3.) What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of '5', sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?

4.) How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas.


I had spent a decent amount of time debugging this code. Overall this was a rather challenging homework. But I was glad I could get it all done.
